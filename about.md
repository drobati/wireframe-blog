## My Journey

I started my coding journey when I was a kid and have since dived into numerous projects, exploring different programming languages and frameworks. My passion for technology has led me to experiment with everything from backend databases to front-end frameworks and everything in between.

After highschool I attended Southern Polytechnic State University (now Kennesaw State University) where I studied Computer Science. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2011.

Throughout college, I worked as a developer, starting with Python building test automation, eventually breaking into web development as full-stack developer.
I'm currently a software engineer at [Priority Payment Systems](https://prioritycommerce.com/). Where I work with react and node daily.

2. **To Share:** This is a space where I share my personal projects, challenges I've encountered, and the solutions I've discovered along the way.

3. **To Connect:** I believe in the power of community and connection. This blog allows me to connect with like-minded individuals, exchange ideas, and grow together in our collective knowledge.
