Web components represent a powerful, modern approach to web development, allowing for encapsulation and reusability of custom elements. My recent project to build a blog using Wired Web Components and Jekyll offered a perfect opportunity to dive deep into this technology. In this post, I'll share my journey, challenges, and insights gained from this experience.

## Choosing the Technology Stack

My adventure began with selecting the right tools. I chose [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator, for its simplicity and compatibility with GitHub Pages. For the UI, I decided to experiment with [Wired Elements](https://wiredjs.com/), a set of web components with a unique hand-drawn style. These components are not only visually distinctive but also easy to integrate into a web project.

## Integrating Wired Elements with Jekyll

The integration process involved a few key steps:

- **Setting Up Jekyll:** I started by setting up a Jekyll project and familiarizing myself with its structure and configuration.
- **Customizing Layouts:** Next, I customized the Jekyll layouts. Instead of using standard HTML elements, I incorporated Wired Elements, such as `<wired-button>` and `<wired-input>`.
- **Styling:** To complement the sketchy look of Wired Elements, I crafted a custom CSS that aligned with the overall aesthetics.

## Challenges Faced

The journey wasn't without its challenges. Here are a few hurdles I encountered:

- **Browser Compatibility:** Ensuring that the web components looked consistent across different browsers was crucial.
- **Responsive Design:** I had to ensure that the components were responsive and adapted well to various screen sizes.
- **Learning Curve:** As with any new technology, there was a learning curve involved in understanding how to best utilize web components in Jekyll.

## Key Takeaways

This project was immensely educational. Here are my key takeaways:

- **Encapsulation is Powerful:** Web components allow for encapsulation of functionality, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
- **Customization is Key:** The ability to customize both the look and functionality of elements is a significant advantage.
- **Community Resources:** The web development community offers a wealth of resources and support, which was invaluable in overcoming challenges.

## Conclusion

Experimenting with web components in the creation of this blog has been a rewarding endeavor. It not only enhanced my web development skills but also resulted in a unique and functional blog. I highly encourage other developers to explore web components in their projects.

*Happy Coding!*
